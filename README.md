# zfs-compression-evaluator
## What This program does
The `zfs-compression-evaluator` script evaluates and compares different compression algorithms based on their performance metrics. It uses data from a provided Excel file containing details about various compression algorithms, such as compression ratios, read/write speeds, and IOPS. The program calculates an overall score for each algorithm, considering the weights for various metrics like compression ratio, sequential read/write IOPS, and random read/write IOPS. The results are then displayed and saved to a CSV file, making it easy to identify the best compression algorithms for your use case. The data that was used came from the following github issue: [Performance degradation with ZFS compression on 0.8.3+](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/9735#issuecomment-570082078)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
    - `pandas`
    - `json`
    - `unittest`
    - `openpyxl`

These can be installed using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```
## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script files.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LilyTheOtter/zfs-compression-evaluator
    ```

2. Install required Python dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure that you have the necessary input files:
    - `compression algorithms filtered.xlsx`: The input Excel file containing the compression algorithms data.
    - `weights.json`: The JSON file containing the weights for scoring.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the required files are in place:
    - `compression algorithms filtered.xlsx`: This file should contain the compression algorithms data.
    - `weights.json`: This file contains the weights that will be used to calculate the scores. If you donâ€™t have this file, refer to the example `weights.json` structure provided in the installation section.

2. Modify the `weights.json` file if necessary to reflect your preferred weightings for the compression metrics (such as sequential and random read/write speeds and compression ratios).

3. To run the script and calculate the compression scores, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 compression_comparison.py
    ```

4. The script will process the data and print the top compression algorithms along with their scores.

5. The results will be saved as a CSV file (`compression_algorithms_results.csv`) in the same directory as the script. You can open this CSV file for further analysis or use it for reporting purposes.

## Example

The script will print the top compression algorithms based on their scores. For example:

```text
Top Compression Algorithms:
   Algorithm  Sequential Compression Ratio  Random Compression Ratio     Score
34   zstd-19                          3.66                      1.98  0.921568
33   zstd-18                          3.65                      1.98  0.917809
30   zstd-15                          3.47                      1.98  0.915996
27   zstd-12                          3.43                      1.98  0.915025
22    zstd-7                          3.35                      1.98  0.913821

The results will be saved in a CSV file named `compression_algorithms_results.csv` in the same directory as the script. You can open this CSV file to view the complete list of compression algorithms, their respective compression ratios, and calculated scores.

```json
